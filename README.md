Warlords

What is it ?
-----------------

In the distant future, humanity has found a new method of diplomacy in the form of a sport set in intergalactic territory, known as Spacelords.
In this sport, countries send off their most dangerous criminals worthy of execution out to space in specially designed pods. A rectangular arena is set up, and players are matched to fight to the death for their country in a knockout tournament where losing means death.
Four players participate in a single round of Spacelords. Rounds are played until there is one winner, who is sent back home as a national hero, with all crimes forgiven and a chance to start their life anew. The losers, however, will have paid for their crimes with death.
You are a wrongly accused criminal sent from your home country to participate in the next round of Warlords. Determined to win and clear your name in front of the billions watching, you have been transported to the arena to start the match.

How to Play
-----------------

Navigation is done using the arrow keys to select an option and ENTER to select.

The objective of the game is to destroy all other opponent's bases while defending your own. If the timer runs out before this occurs (2 minute timer), the winner is decided based on the player with the highest number of bricks remaining.

In single player mode, use the arrow keys to move the paddle around.
You will control the top left player.

In local multiplayer mode, use the following keys to move the players around:
Player 1 - LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys
Player 2 - A and D
Player 3 - J and L
Player 4 - V and N

General controls:
ESC - if in game, goes back to the main menu.
P - pauses the game and opens up the pause menu.
T (cheat) - decreases the time remaining in the round by 5 seconds.
PGDN - reduces the time remaining to zero so the game ends immediately.
